# Cursor Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-cursor-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: cursor types, AI models, user interactions, data flow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (cursor-specific data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY for cursor generation
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Consider cursor-specific requirements (formats, sizes, performance)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "cursor generation" without format), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas for cursor features**:
   - Cursor formats and sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, etc.)
   - AI model preferences and capabilities
   - Generation time limits and performance
   - User permission levels and sharing
   - Export formats and compatibility
   - Storage and bandwidth considerations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey for cursor creation/management in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI generation fails or times out?
- How does the system handle different cursor formats and sizes?
- What if users exceed generation limits or storage quotas?
- How are cursor variants managed and organized?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific cursor capability, e.g., "generate cursor designs from text prompts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "support multiple cursor formats (16x16, 32x32, 64x64)"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "preview cursors before downloading"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "store cursor metadata and generation history"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "handle generation failures gracefully"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate cursors in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cursor formats not specified - .cur, .ani, .png?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST limit generation to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rate limits not specified - per user, per hour, per day?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cursor**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **Cursor Variant**: [What it represents, relationships to base cursor]
- **Generation Request**: [What it represents, tracking generation process]
