Always avoid using the `any` type or TypeScript workarounds unless absolutely necessary, and only with clear justification. Instead, strive to identify and resolve the root cause of type issues.

Prefer using existing types or schema definitions rather than declaring new types. Whenever possible, infer types directly from the database schema, as this ensures the most accurate and up-to-date type definitions.

All new file names must be in kebab-case.

for combining tailwind classes, use the `cn` function from `@/lib/utils.ts` and not string templating.
