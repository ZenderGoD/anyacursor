# Feature Specification: Conversational AI Cursor Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-conversational-ai-cursor`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a conversational AI interface for cursor generation with tool calling, with chat streaming capabilities and image streaming capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: cursor types, AI models, user interactions, data flow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (cursor-specific data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY for cursor generation
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Consider cursor-specific requirements (formats, sizes, performance)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to generate custom cursor designs through a natural conversation with an AI assistant, allowing them to describe their needs in plain language and receive real-time streaming responses with both text and image updates as the cursor is being generated.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to generate a cursor, **When** they describe their needs to the AI in natural language, **Then** the system streams both text responses and image updates in real-time
2. **Given** a user is having a conversation about cursor design, **When** they ask for modifications or variations, **Then** the AI can call tools to generate new cursor variants while streaming the conversation
3. **Given** a user generates a cursor through conversation, **When** the generation process is ongoing, **Then** they see real-time streaming updates of both the AI's responses and the cursor image being generated
4. **Given** a user wants to refine their cursor, **When** they provide feedback through chat, **Then** the system can generate new variations while maintaining the conversational flow

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI generation fails during streaming?
- How does the system handle multiple concurrent cursor generation requests?
- What if users want to generate cursors in different formats simultaneously?
- How are streaming connections managed when users navigate away and return?
- What happens when image streaming is interrupted or fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a conversational AI interface that accepts natural language descriptions for cursor generation
- **FR-002**: System MUST stream text responses in real-time as the AI processes user requests
- **FR-003**: System MUST stream image updates in real-time during cursor generation process
- **FR-004**: System MUST support tool calling within the conversational flow for cursor generation and management
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle multiple cursor formats (cur, ani, png) and sizes (16x16, 32x32, 64x64) through conversation
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain conversation context across multiple cursor generation requests
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time feedback on generation progress through both text and visual updates
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle conversation interruptions and allow users to resume or modify requests
- **FR-009**: System MUST support concurrent streaming of multiple cursor generations
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle streaming failures with appropriate fallback mechanisms

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Conversation Thread**: Represents an ongoing chat session with the AI assistant
- **Cursor Generation Request**: Tracks cursor generation initiated through conversation
- **Streaming Session**: Manages real-time text and image streaming for a generation request
- **Tool Call**: Represents AI tool invocations within the conversational flow
- **Generation Progress**: Tracks real-time progress of cursor generation with streaming updates
