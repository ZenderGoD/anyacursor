# Feature Specification: Chat Interface Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-chat-interface-web-app`  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "make a chat interface web app for text to text and text to image generation use: 1. openroute for LLM 2. use FAL for Image gen model : fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1-ultra for text-to-image, fal-ai/gemini-25-flash-image/edit for image-to-image editing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: chat interface, text generation, image generation, OpenRouter, FAL AI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (chat-specific data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY for chat interface
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Consider chat-specific requirements (real-time, multimodal, streaming)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to create a chat interface web app for text to text and text to image generation, allowing them to have conversational interactions with AI models for both text responses and image creation through a unified interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to generate text responses, **When** they type a message in the chat interface, **Then** the system processes the request through OpenRouter and displays the AI response in real-time
2. **Given** a user wants to generate images from text, **When** they describe an image in the chat, **Then** the system uses FAL AI Flux Pro to generate the image and displays it in the chat
3. **Given** a user wants to edit an existing image, **When** they upload an image and provide editing instructions, **Then** the system uses FAL AI Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to edit the image and displays the result
4. **Given** a user is in an active chat session, **When** they switch between text, text-to-image, and image-to-image modes, **Then** the system maintains conversation context and provides appropriate responses
5. **Given** a user generates content, **When** the generation fails or times out, **Then** they receive clear error messages and can retry the operation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OpenRouter API is unavailable or rate limited?
- How does the system handle long-running image generation requests?
- What if users provide invalid image prompts or unsupported formats?
- How are conversation histories managed and stored?
- What happens when users exceed usage limits or quotas?
- How does the system handle concurrent users and resource management?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a real-time chat interface for text-based conversations
- **FR-002**: System MUST support text-to-text generation using OpenRouter LLM services
- **FR-003**: System MUST support text-to-image generation using FAL AI Flux Pro v1.1 Ultra model
- **FR-004**: System MUST support image-to-image editing using FAL AI Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model
- **FR-005**: System MUST display generated images inline within the chat interface
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain conversation history and context across interactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear visual indicators for different content types (text vs images)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle generation failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST support streaming responses for real-time text generation
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to retry failed operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide loading states during content generation
- **FR-012**: System MUST support image upload for image-to-image editing workflows

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Session**: Represents a conversation thread with unique identifier and metadata
- **Message**: Represents individual chat messages with content, type (text/image), and timestamp
- **Generation Request**: Tracks the status and results of AI generation operations
- **User Context**: Maintains user preferences and conversation history
- **Generated Content**: Stores text responses and image URLs with metadata
