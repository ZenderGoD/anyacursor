## How to Use the Spec Kit Agent

You can now simply type your feature request to me, and I'll pass it to the Spec Kit Agent to generate comprehensive specifications, plans, and tasks.

### Simple Commands

Just type any of these to me:

#### 1. Generate Complete Workflow
```
/specify [your feature description]
```

**Example:**
```

```

#### 2. Generate Just Specification
```
/spec [your feature description]
```

**Example:**
```
/spec Create a cursor collection management system with search and filtering
```

#### 3. Generate Technical Plan
```
/plan [your feature description]
```

**Example:**
```
/plan Build a cursor sharing and collaboration system
```

#### 4. Generate Task Breakdown
```
/tasks [your feature description]
```

**Example:**
```
/tasks Implement cursor export functionality with multiple formats
```

### Advanced Commands

You can also provide additional context:

```
/specify [feature description] with [tech stack] for [user context] estimated [time]
```

**Example:**
```
/specify Build a cursor generation interface with Vercel AI SDK for anyacursor platform estimated 3-4 days
```

### What You'll Get Back

For each command, the Spec Kit Agent will generate:

1. **Specification** - Business-focused requirements and user scenarios
2. **Technical Plan** - Architecture, database design, and implementation phases
3. **Task Breakdown** - Actionable tasks with dependencies, effort estimates, and acceptance criteria

All outputs follow:
- âœ… **Raj's coding patterns** and architecture principles
- âœ… **Anyacursor constitution** and coding standards
- âœ… **Vercel AI SDK + Convex** integration patterns
- âœ… **Type safety** and proper error handling
- âœ… **Performance optimization** and security best practices

### Example Workflow

**You type:**
```
/specify Build a conversational AI interface for cursor generation with tool calling
```

**I'll respond with:**
- Complete specification with user scenarios and requirements
- Technical plan with Vercel AI SDK + Convex architecture
- Task breakdown with 12+ actionable tasks organized in phases
- All following Raj's patterns and your constitution
